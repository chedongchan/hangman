A repository containing descriptions of AiCore tasks, skills required to tackle them and codes that complete them. 


# AiCore Hangman Project Documentation

> Hangman Game Project. 

## Milestone 1: Set up the environment

- Q: What have you built? 
- A: Set up Github Repository. New directories.

- Q: What technologies have you used? 
- A: VS Code, MiniConda and Git. Command line - using terminal commands to manipulate files and directories. 

- Q: Why have you used those?
- A: VS Code works as the text editor. MiniConda is a useful virtual environment generating software. Git is a version control system that allows  everyone to track changes, revert back to a previous (usually 'working' version), contribute towards a final product (main/master branch).

## Milestone 2: Create the variables for the game

- Q: What have you developed within the environment?
- A: Writing scripts that can create, manipulate numbers, strings, lists, overall assinging/storing them to variables which can be called and/or printed.

- Q: What utilities have you learnt this time?
- A: I learnt to install pacakges in base and virtual environments for use. Importing modules that have useful functions embedded inside them.

## Milestone 3: Check if the guessed character is in the word

- Q: What utilities have you learnt this time?
- A: In this milestone, I have learnt to write several functions by defining them first, then calling them with or without arguments. I have developed if statements that check for certain types and range of input, thus filtering unwanted input values.

- Q: What did I struggle with?
- A: Recursive functions was a challenge to get my head around it. It still is rather difficult to understand. At the moment, I am using trial and error to find the script that works but I imagine I will eventually understand it well.

## Milestone 4: Check if the guessed character is in the word

- Q: What utilities have you learnt this time?
- A: In this milestone, I have learnt to create a class and learn to define functions within the class. Classes can allow for unique functions that only work in instances where the class is called. 

- Q: What did I struggle with?
- A: To understand exactly how classes work. How one can manipulate the initialised values from subsequent functions. However, with some trial and errors, and thinking about the logic of classes, I believe I have at least understood enough to make the script run- though I believe there should be a cleaner way to do this... For example, I am not sure if I am supposed to consistently refer to self._insert variable__ throughout the class. I am also not entirely sure why some variables are underscored with red error lines in the code.

## Milestone 5: Putting it all together.

- Q: What utilities have you learnt this time?
- A: In this milestone, I have learnt to simplify each function to do one task (if possible) and then place them under a single function that follows a overarching logic gate required for the Hangman game. 

- Q: What did I struggle with?
- A: There were many while loops within the code, which meant that when putting all the functions together, I got lost which loop was not being broken in order for the code to proceed to the next line. After some troubleshooting, such as setting the conditions False from the very beginning, I was able to narrow down the culprit to a single while loop. Turn out, my last while loop conditional IF statements were not in the right order.

# Milestone 5: Putting it all together

# Task 1: Code the logic of the game

def play_game():
    word_list = ["apple","lychee", "mangosteen", "clementine","grape"]
    game = Hangman(word_list)
    game.random_word()
    game.word_guess_list()
    game.num_unique_letter()

    p = True
    while p == True:
        if game.num_letters > 0 and game.num_lives > 0: 
            game.ask_for_input()
            
            

        elif game.num_lives == 0:
            print("You lost!")
            p = False

        elif game.num_lives > 0 and game.num_letters == 0:
            print("You won the game!")
            p = False

        

        else:
            break
        
play_game()

# Task 2: Define play_game function.

# Logic: 
# 1. Set a variable called Word_list inside the function (in the future, this can be an argument for the function instead...)
# 2. Call an instance of Hangman using the word_list as the input argument. Number of lives are set to 5 as default.
# 3. Call the random_word() function to randomly select a word from word_list.
# 4. Call the word_guess_list() function, which generates two lists. The first one sequentially stores each letter per index of the list. The second is the 'hidden behind underscores' version of the same list.
# 5. Call the num_unique_letter() function, which generates a print statement based on how many remaining unique letters the player has to guess.
# 6. While loop that continues until the condition is set to False, contains conditional if statements that either keep the loop condition true or false:
#   a) Calls the ask_for_input() function if both number of unique letters and number of lives are greater than 0. 
#   b) If number of lives reach 0, set loop condition to be False, printing out "You lost!" message, and ending the game.
#   c) If number of lives is greater than 0 but no more unique letters exist (every letter guessed!), then set loop condition to be False, printing out "You won the game!" message, and ending the game.
# 7. Call the function outside.
